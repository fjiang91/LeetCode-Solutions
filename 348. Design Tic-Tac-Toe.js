//Design a Tic Tac Toe on a n x n matrix board

//Faster Approach - Code Aspiration from bdwalker on LeetCode
//O(1) time complexity - to check winner
//O(n) space complexity - to store additional
//Use a row and col array to keep track of the num within the index
//Use diagonal and revDiagonal for keeping the track
//When the num is equal to the size, then we know that a player have fill up the whole row/col/diagonal/revDiagonal
var TicTacToe = function(n) {
  this.winPlayer = 0;
  this.winNum = n;
  this.row = new Array(n).fill(0);

  this.diagonal = 0;
  this.revDiagonal = 0;

//O(n^2 time complexity)

      }
      this.winCombo.push(horizontalWin);
      this.winCombo.push(verticalWin);
  }

  //Generate diagonal and reverseDiagonal winning combo

  }
  this.winCombo.push(diagonalWin);

//Check the winner each time when a player moves
